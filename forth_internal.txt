New Plan!

run_word needs to be a bytecode interpreter. Just simple enough to execute calls to function tokens, jumps back and forth, etc.
The plan to put constants into anonymous words is scuttled a bit by the concept of compiling working on the top word in the dictionary, as those anonymous words become the new "top words".
One solution is to have a top_word pointer that refers to the word being compiled. Another is to build in such constant finding into the bytecode.
